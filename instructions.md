  cd trashdrop-collector
  npm install tailwindcss lucide-react @supabase/supabase-js
  npx tailwindcss init -p
```



### 2. Tailwind CSS Configuration

* Configure `tailwind.config.js` with desired settings.

### 3. Lucide Icons Integration

* Import icons as React components:([YouTube][6])

```javascript
  import { Camera } from 'lucide-react';
```



* Use in components:([Lucide][7])

```jsx
  <Camera size={24} color="black" />
```


Lucide Icons are tree-shakable and customizable. ([Lucide][7])

### 4. Supabase Setup

* Create a Supabase project and obtain the API keys.
* Initialize Supabase client:([Supabase][4])

```javascript
  import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

  const supabase = createClient('https://your-project.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key');
```



### 5. PWA Configuration

* Create `manifest.json` in the `public` directory with appropriate metadata.
* Configure Next.js to use `next-pwa` for service worker support.
* Add an install button using the `beforeinstallprompt` event. ([Gist][8])

### 6. Map Integration

* Use Leaflet.js or a similar library to integrate OpenStreetMap.
* Implement radius filtering and trash type filtering functionalities.

### 7. QR Code Scanning

* Utilize HTML5 Web APIs or third-party libraries to implement QR code scanning within modals.

### 8. Geofencing

* Use the Browser Geolocation API to determine the user's location.
* Implement custom logic to activate certain features (e.g., "Dispose Bag Now") only within a 50m radius of disposal centers.

### 9. Notifications

* Integrate OneSignal with Supabase Edge Functions to send real-time push notifications. ([Supabase][4])
